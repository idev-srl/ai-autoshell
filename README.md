AI-AutoShell is a modern, self-contained shell written in C++20. It does <em>not</em> delegate to /bin/sh; it implements its own lexer, parser, expander and POSIX executor with job control. Future versions will integrate an LLM that can translate natural language requests into safe, structured execution plans.

## 1. Motivation & Vision

Traditional shells mix parsing, expansion and execution with decades of legacy behavior. AI-AutoShell aims to:

- Provide a clean, testable C++20 implementation of a POSIX-like interactive shell.
- Offer structured execution primitives (argv + redirections) suitable for LLM planning without free-form text evaluation.
- Support an "auto" (execute) and "suggest" (propose only) AI mode for safe adoption.
- Maintain strict safety around dangerous operations (deletions, privileged, network).

## 2. Key Features (Current MVP)

- Built-ins: `cd`, `pwd`, `exit`, `echo`, `export`, `unset`, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`.
- Operators: pipelines `|`, logical `&&` / `||`, list `;`, background `&`.
- Redirections: `>`, `>>`, `<`, `2>`, `2>&1`.
- Expansions: `~`, `$VAR`, `${VAR}` (globbing & command substitution pending).
- Job control: list jobs, foreground/background movement, basic signals.
- Interactive line editor: history navigation (↑/↓), tab completion (context-aware, directory filtering for `cd`), colored suggestions.
- Clean separation: Lexer → Parser (AST) → Expander → Executor POSIX.

```

## 4. Building & Running
Requirements: C++20 compiler (clang++ or g++), CMake ≥ 3.24.
```

cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
./build/ai-autoshell

```
Run tests (if present):
```

ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

```

## 5. Configuration (`~/.ai-autoshellrc`)
Create a file in your home directory:
```

color=on

```
Placeholders: `{user}`, `{host}`, `{cwd}`, `{status}` (last exit code). Set `color=off` to disable ANSI colors.

## 6. Command Completion & Colors
Tab completion supports:
- Built-ins (cyan)
- Executables in `$PATH` (green, cached)
- Directories (blue, trailing `/`)
- Context-sensitive `cd` (only directories, supports `~/`, `./`, `../`, absolute paths)
Hidden entries only shown when you start the prefix with `.`. Double-Tab lists matches in columns with colors.

## 7. Roadmap
Near-term:
- Globbing (`*`, `?`, `[]`)
- Command substitution `$(...)`
- Safer signal handling & job suspension/resume improvements
- LLM planner module producing JSON execution plans (no free-form shell strings)
Mid-term:
- Windows port (CreateProcess, pipes, job objects)
- Config via YAML/TOML
- "Suggest" vs "Auto" AI modes with confirmation layer
- Plugin/module system

## 8. Contributing
Pull requests welcome. Please:
1. Keep changes modular (one concern per PR).
2. Add/extend tests for new behavior.
3. Run `ctest` and ensure green before requesting review.
4. Avoid introducing unsafe constructs (`system`, `popen`, shell text concatenation).

## 9. Security & Safety Principles
- No execution of raw text generated by LLM; only structured argv vectors.
- Confirmation required for elevated/dangerous operations (future AI integration).
- No automatic privilege escalation.
- Defensive error handling: prefer explicit checks & clear stderr messages.

### Development Standards
Compiler flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` (consider sanitizers in debug: `-fsanitize=address,undefined`).
Testing: GoogleTest via CTest.
Avoid: `system()`, `popen()`, `/bin/sh` delegation, dynamic code eval.

### Quick Example
```

echo "hello" | cat
false && echo no || echo recovered
cd /tmp && echo "In tmp"; pwd

```

### Status Environment Variable
The shell exports `?` with the last command exit code (e.g., use `{status}` in the prompt format).
